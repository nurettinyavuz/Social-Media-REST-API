# Social Media REST API

• In the project I developed, users can perform Login-Register operations via a simple social media REST API, as well as perform post operations with CRUD operations; They can also add likes and dislikes to their posts.

• Since this is only the backend part of the project, the technologies I generally use in the project are; I used Node.js, express.js, mongoDB technologies.
